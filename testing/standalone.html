# Unit-testing

* Unit-testing is the main development assistant tool:

    * Coding simplification.

    * Less regression errors.

    * Easy debugging.

    * Reading and understanding your code is much easier for your colleagues.

    * System design (always) and architecture (sometimes) improvement.

__Think about system design, architecture AND your colleagues.__

# Unit-testing is simple... with Go

* Unit testing in Go significantly simpler than in C++ because of:

    * Embedded unit-testing toolchain,

    * Packages,

    * Interfaces, and

    * Circuit dependency ban.

__Unit-testing in Go is very simple.__

# What and how should we test?

* Class/package level behaviour.

* Mock all external dependencies.

* Mock all hardware level API.

* Try to avoid timers and sleeps. If you must use them, make delays configurable.

# Fuzzing

* One of the most wonderful and often ignored type of tests.

* Very popular across DevSecOps.

* Helps you to cover all tricky parts in your code.

---
# How fuzzing looks

You need to write a test function of the form:

```go
func Fuzz(data []byte) int
```

Fuzzer:

* Generates random input.

* Monitors execution coverage.

* Monitors crashes/panics.
