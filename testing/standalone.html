# Unit-testing

### Unit-testing is the main development assistant tool:

* Coding simplification.

* Less regression errors.

* Easy debugging.

* Reading and understanding your code is much easier for your colleagues.

* System design (always) and architecture (sometimes) improvement.

    * _We will talk about testing techniques that improve architecture a bit later._

---
# Unit-testing is simple... with Go

### Unit testing in Go significantly simpler than in C++ or many other languages because of:

* Embedded unit-testing toolchain.

* Packages AND

    * Interfaces AND

        * Circuit dependency ban.

---
# What and how should you test with unit-tests?

### Tests target is object/package level behavior.

You can achieve it with:

* Mocking all external dependencies.

* Mocking all hardware level API.

* Testing results, but not internal functions calls sequence.

* Try to avoid timers and sleeps. If you must use them, make delays configurable.

---
# External dependencies mocking

Lets say we need to read something

```go
fn foo(SomeType dataSource) {
    buf := make([]byte, 5)
    data, err := dataSource.Read(buf)
    ...
}
```
--
Using exact type, hard dependency.
```go
SomeType == File
```
--
Using interface, soft dependency.
```go
type Reader interface {
    Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)
}
```
---
# Test results, but not internal functions calls sequence

The worst unit-test ever

```go
mockObj.EXPECT().SomeMethod_1("first")
mockObj.EXPECT().SomeMethod_2("second")
mockObj.EXPECT().SomeMethod_3("third")
...
mockObj.EXPECT().SomeMethod_1("fourth")
...
```

### Main issues:

* Functions calls sequence testing instead of results testing.

* Hard-coded internal logic expectations.

---
# Coverage and automation tips

### Cover at least 75% of you code.

* Applications with many low-level code could be difficult to cover and lower coverage is fine.

* 100% tests coverage is achievable, but too expensive and very demotivating!

--

### Protect unit tests from coverage degradation.

* Pipeline automation (Jenkins, TeamCity, Travis CI, etc.) allows to add coverage thresholds.

--

### Write tests before or together with code, but not after.

* improves code design a lot.

* prevents you (or your management) from de-prioritizing test developement tasks.

---
# Fuzzing

* One of the most wonderful and often ignored type of tests.

* Very popular across DevSecOps.

* Helps you to cover all tricky parts in your code.

    * you have ~100% tests coverage in the end almost for free.

* There are two well-known fuzzer implementations today:
    
    * `google/gofuzz` 

    * and `dvyukov/go-fuzz`

---
# How fuzzing looks

You need to write a test function of the form:

```go
func Fuzz(data []byte) int
```

Fuzzer:

* Generates random input.

* Monitors execution coverage.

* Monitors crashes/panics.

* Generates crash-dumps and crash data.

# Performance testing

### Easy to develop:

* Just call your critical workflow many times

### Main challenges:

* virtualization

* CI/CD support
    
    * Some CI/CD supports performance testing, for example GitHub action

    * If you know how to organize with Jenkins, please let me know ðŸ˜’

# Integration testing. Why?


The point of integration testing is **to test whether many separately developed modules work together as expected**.

# Integration testing. What?

#### A simple project structure

* How will we tests it?

* Can integration tests help us with better architecture?

# Integration testing. How?

### Complete system simulation.

* **Component** level dependency mocking.

* Setting-up and tear-down automation.


### Use-case based workflow simulation.

* User actions simulation.
    
    * Just code it.

* Traffic/events replaying.

---
# Integration testing. Tips.

### Integration tests are flaky

* Do expect tests will report false positive from time to time. 

--

### Integration tests tool-chain

* Python often is the best option for integration tests development.

* Except it's too slow for you workflow.

--

### Integration tests are expensive

* Would be better to have SDETs but not expect your developers will code AND support it.
