# Unit testing

* Unit-testing is the main development assistant tool:

    * Coding simplification.

    * Less regression errors.

    * Easy to debug your code.

    * Your colleagues can more easy read and understand your code.

    * Improve system design (always) and architecture (sometimes).

__Do not merge new code while it's not covered by unit tests!__

__To think about system design, architecture AND your colleagues.__

# Unit-testing is simple... with Go

* Unit testing in Go significantly simpler than in C++ because of:

    * Embedded unit-testing toolchain.

    * Packages.

    * Interfaces.

    * And circuit dependency ban.

__Unit-testing in Go is very simple.__

# What and how should we test?

* Class/package level behaviour.

* Mock all external dependencies.

* Mock all hardware level API.

* Try to avoid timers and sleeps. If it's impossible, make delays configurable.

# Fuzzing

* One of the most wonderful and often ignored type of tests.

* Very popular across DevSecOps.

* Helps you to cover all tricky parts in your code.

---
# Fuzzing, how it looks like

You need to write a test function of the form:

```go
func Fuzz(data []byte) int
```

Fuzzer do:

* Generate random input.

* Monitor for execution coverage.

* Monitor for crashes/panics.
