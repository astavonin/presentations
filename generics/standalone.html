# Do we need generics?

* all code is "generic" in a dynamically typed world

```python
def my_min(l, r):
    return l if l < r else r

my_min(2, 1)
# > 1
my_min("foo", "boo")
# > 'boo'
```
???
* in case of dynamically typed languages any function usually accept any arguments
    * not valid for Elixir and Erlang, also Python has typing module for static analysis
* this is nice but not free
    * type manipulation in runtime requires reflection, which is always slow
    * type manipulation in runtime is always insecure. It would better to fail on compile-time, but not in production.

--

* almost all static typed languages have generics (C++, Java, C# and so on)

```cpp
template<typename T>
const T& min(const T& l, const T& r)
{
  if (l < r)
    return l;
  return r;
}
```
???

* almost all static typed languages have generics (C++, Java, C# and so on), but there are some downsides like:
    * meta-programming could be very challenging.
    * could take a long time to compile.

---
# Can we create generic code in Go now?

* There are few embedded generic functions in `builtin` like `make`, `append`, `delete`, and so on.
???
* but can we create generic code in Go now?
* even today Go has a few embedded generic functions in `builtin` package like `make`, `append`, `delete`, and so on.

--

* we have can use `interface{}`.

```go
func min(l interface{}, r interface{}) {
    // some type checks here
}
```
???
* but what we can do today for creating some generic code? Lets say we would like to have a `min` function which may work with any type.

* we can use empty interfaces like, which is not a good idea:
    * we will have same runtime errors as for dynamic typing languages
    * and this approach is slow because of type checks in run time

--

* we can use a generator.

```go
//go:generate genny gen out=gen-$GOFILE "Type=string,int"
func min(l, r Type) {
    if l < r {
        return l
    }
    return r
}
```
???
* the second approach is to use generators.
    * generators are widely used in Go, you can think about Stringers, Protobuf and so on.
* as a bonus of generators usage you'll have
    * valid types during compilation
    * no extra checks at runtime, means your code is faster
* BUT extra level of complexity, which means you need to know not only Go, but some "genny" dialect in this case, 
* and it may affect your favorite IDE behavior

# Generics in Go, general info

```go
func Print[T any](s []T) {
    for _, v := range s {
        fmt.Print(v)
    }
}
```

* Functions can have an additional type parameter list that uses square brackets

* These type parameters can be used by the regular parameters and in the function body

* Each type parameter has a type constraint

* Type constraints are interface types

* The new predeclared name `any` is equal to `interface{}`
???
* That was the Go state valid for 1.16, but since 1.17 as experimental feature there are some changes
* read slide text -->
* Taking all these into account we can create a generic `Print` function accepting slice `s` of type `T` which could be anything

---
# Parameter type constraints

Generic functions may **only use operations permitted by the type constraint**


```go
func Join[T any](s []T, sep string) (ret string) {
    for _, v := range s {
        ret += v.String()
        ret += sep
    }
    return ret
}
```
???
* lets have a look bit more complicated example
* `Join` call should merge a slice of something into a string
* next code is valid expectations for languages like C++
* but not for Go as "Generic functions may only use operations permitted by the type constraint"
* it means that if Stringer interface in undefined, compilation will failed wit message about `v` dot `String` undefined, type bound for `T` has no method `String`
* You may think, but why generic `Print` function above was working well?

--

The generic `Print` function does not call any `T` methods.
```go
func Print[T any](s []T) {
    for _, v := range s {
        fmt.Print(v)
    }
}
```
???
* generic `Print` do call `fmt.Print` only, which has the next definition
--
```go
func Print(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error) {
    // ...
}
```
???
* `fmt.Print` uses empty interface and have reflection calls inside, this is the only reason why this code is valid
---
# Satisfying compiler type constraints

To define the new `Stringer` interface.

```go
type Stringer interface {
    String() string
}
```
???
* for satisfying the compiler we should define `String` method as a part of an interface, which is pretty standard for Go
* and as the next step we should slightly change `Join` definition
--
To change generic function definition `any` -> `Stringer`

```go
func Join[T Stringer](s []T, sep string) (ret string) {
    for _, v := range s {
        ret += v.String()
        ret += sep
    }
    return ret
}
```
???
* `T any` -> `T Stringer`, the rest is the same
-----
* all these looks very familiar and you can implement more or less the same with current version of Go and interfaces.
* but why do we need generics in such the case?

---
# Pre-generics containers (1/2)

`sync.Map` is a "generic" container which is available since 1.9

```go
var sm sync.Map
sm.Store("hello", "world")

result, _ := sm.Load("hello")

fmt.Println(result)
```
???
* today we have `sync.Map`, it is a kind of "generic" container which is available since 1.9
* you can put any value of any type using a key into it with `Store`
* and receive it back with `Load`
* but it's not a generics approach because we use empty interface here for our "magic"
* even some functions will work as expected, for example `fmt.Println` will print `result` value

--
`Store`/`Load` "magic"

```go
func (m *Map) Store(key, value interface{}) {
    // ...
}
func (m *Map) Load(key interface{}) (value interface{}, ok bool) {
    // ...
}
```
???
* but we should do all type conversions in runtime have all downsides of this approach
    * `Store` and `Load` operates with empty interfaces
---
# Pre-generics containers (2/2)

The snippet above is valid only because of `Println` reflection "magic".

```go
func Println(a ...interface{}) (n int, err error) {
    // ...
}
```
???
* The snippet above is valid only because of Println reflection "magic", but not because the `sync.Map` is generic container.
--
will not compile
```go
func MyPrintln(data string) {
    fmt.Println(data)
}

result, _ := sm.Load("hello")
MyPrintln(result)
```

???
* for example, next code has compilation error.
* this is the main reason why Go do not have rich algorithms and/or containers library, while almost all other programming languages have.

---
# Generic map (1/3)

Types can also have a type parameter list: `type M[T any] []T`

```go
type Map[K comparable, V any] struct {
    m map[K]V
}
```
???
* how generics will help here?
* lets create a sketch for generic `Map` type
* types (structs), same as functions, can also have a type parameter list
* in this case we have type `Map` with two type parameters: `K` with `comparable` constraint and `V` of any type
* `K` is limited to `comparable` because of Go-embedded `map` expectations
--
Each generic type should be instantiated with expected types like `Map[K, V]{...}`

```go
func NewMap[K comparable, V any]() Map[K, V] {
    return Map[K, V]{m: make(map[K]V)}
}
```
???
* Each generic type should be instantiated with expected types like `Map[K, V]{...}` in the return statement
--
This is indirect instantiation, and types are forwarding from the upper level where NewMap will be called.

```go
sm := NewMap[string, string]()
```
???
* This is indirect instantiation, and types are forwarding from the upper level where `NewMap` will be called.
---
# Generic map (2/3)

* Generic types can have methods.

* Type of a method must declare the same number of type parameters as in the type's definition.

* Type parameters are declared without any constraint.

```go
func (m Map[K, V]) Store(key K, val V) {
    m.m[key] = val
}

func (m Map[K, V]) Load(key K) (V, bool) {
    v, ok := m.m[key]
    return v, ok
}
```
???
* Generic types can have methods, like `Store` or `Load`.

* Type of a method must declare the same number of type parameters as in the type's definition.
    * as you see `(m Map[K, V])` declares two type arguments `K` and `V`

* Type parameters are declared without any constraint.
    * no `comparable` or `any` 

---
# Generic map (3/3)

The MyPrintln call accepts `string` but **not** `interface{}`

```go
func MyPrintln(data string) {
    fmt.Println(data)
}
```

and will work as expected

```go
sm := NewMap[string, string]()

sm.Store("hello", "world")

result, _ := sm.Load("hello")

MyPrintln(result)
```
???
* generic `Map` works with types, but not empty interface and
* `MyPrintln` from the example will work as expected
* we can store a value of type `string` into the `Map` and recieve back `string`, but not empty interface
---
# Generic algorithms (1/2)

Applying a function to all items in a list with Haskell

```haskell
map (+7) [2,8,9,3]

-- > [9,15,16,10]
```
???
* the second commons use-case for generics is generic algorithms
* almost all languages I know have a way to apply a function to a collection... but not Go
* for example in Haskell applying +7 to list of integers will looks like this
--

Having generics, we can do the same in Go!

* a generic function should work for slices of any types

```go
Map([]int{2, 8, 9, 3}, func(val int) int {
    return val + 7
})

// > [9 15 16 10]

Map([]float64{2.1, 8.1, 9.1, 3.1}, func(val float64) float64 {
    return val + 7.
})

// > [9.1 15.1 16.1 10.1]
```
???
* Having generics, we can do the same in Go!
* lets think about a generic function `Map` which will work for slices of any types, for example...

---
# Generic algorithms (2/2)

* function argument type inference `F` for a function call

* which returns `T` type value based on `func(F) T` definition

```go
func Map[F, T any](s []F, f func(F) T) []T {
    r := make([]T, len(s))
    for i, v := range s {
        r[i] = f(v)
    }
    return r
}
```
???
* for archiving it we need a function with two generic types:
    * generic function `F` and a type `T`
    * both of them use `any` type constraint, but based on the declaration you can see that the first argument is a slice and the second is a function
* keep in mind that you do not need any knowledge of the actual type `T` for creating a new slice `r`, the `make` call
* the `Map` call will apply the function `f` to all elements of the slice `s` and return a new slice `r`

----

* In the same manner, we can implement a lot of other generic algorithms, and most likely, we will have them as a part of the standard library more or less soon
