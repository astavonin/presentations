# Agenda

* ### A bit of history: version control systems (VCS) and build systems evolution.

* ### Mono & Poly repositories pros and cons.

* ### Go and monorepo.

* ### Conclusion.

# A bit of history
### Centralized VCS


.left-column[

* Single giant repository containing all:
    * project code, and
    * third-party libraries, and
    * sometimes binary data

* Well-known representatives of this family:
    * Microsoft Visual SourceSafe
    * Concurrent Versions System

* Download all locally and compile - primitive predecessor of modern monorepo.

# A bit of history
### Decentralized VCS


.left-column[

* Sharing project across multiple repositories.

* Pull-requests-based workflow made sharing changes straightforward and clear.

* Multiple tools for supporting distributed workflow:
    * Ant, Maven, CMake, and so on.
]

.right-column[

# Mono & Poly repositories

* Two primary source code management approaches.

* Polyrepos as default approach.

* A lot of mistery around monorepo.

.footnote[
![](./poly_mono.png)
]

---
# Poly repositories

.left-column[
* Well known and widely used.

* Deviding a project into multiple subprojects.

* Subprojects could represent absolutely anything: a library, executable, microservice, lambda, etc.

* Each subproject has more or less defined boundaries and some level of independence from other subprojects.

# Why polyrepo?

.left-column[
* It's famous; almost everyone knows how to deal with it.

* There are many well-defined practices.

* CI/CD often supports polyrepo workflow out of the box.

* Enforces developers to define interfaces for interacting between components.

* Each component could be relatively easily written using its language.

* Each component can have its workflow, best practices, and high level of independence.

# Why NOT polyrepo?

.left-column[
* Dependencies hell.
    * Different subprojects has different needs and goals.
    * No way to enforce or help with updates from outside of a project.

* Shared project refactoring is a huge pain.
    * No traceable dependencies.
    * Lack of responsibilities sharing.
    * No atomic commits.

* Challenging release process and cross teams coordination.
    * Each polyrepo has its owner with its processes.

# Mono repositories

.left-column[
* All (internal) components has the same version.
    * `trunk` is the only version for all components.

* Force all developers to focus on the common goal - `trunk`.

* The system either works or not; you can no longer say, "our project works well, but...".

* Atomic commits, you do refactoring in all components at once when it's needed.

* Same build environment for all components.
    * compiling all dependencies from scratch.

# Trunk based development

.left-column[
* all child branches contain only one feature (user story, defect, etc.) and owned by single developer.

* trunk is always "green" and ready for release.

* developers can never merge to trunk until all CI tests succeed.
    * trunk-based development is heavily dependent on testing automation: unit testing, integration testing, simulations, and so on.

* CI continuously monitors pipeline state and informs developers about failures.

# Feature flags

.left-column[
* A way to turn on/off a part of the functionality in compile, launch, or run time
    * `build time` - testing or partial inclusion into subsystems.
    * `launch time` - stable but not fully complete features.
    * `runtime` - A/B testing, betas, canary launches.

* Allows to merge incomplete functionality into the trunk and avoid feature branches.

* Could be implemented with: compile flags, command line arguments, environment arguments, special request fields, etc.

# Build systems

.left-column-wide[
* Monorepo-style projects add additional requirements to your build system:
    * _Multi-languages support._ It's not possible to have a dedicated build system for each language.
    * _Scalability._ Need to compile the whole project at once.
    * _Incremental builds._ To compile everything from scratch is too expensive, even at scale.
    * _Caching_. All build artifacts typically stored as distributed cache for compilation speedup.
    * _Incremental tests._ No need to rerun tests for already tested components.
    * _Extensibility._ All projects are unique, and the build system should be easily extendable.

* Monorepo-centric build systems:
    * *Buck* - from Facebook.
    * *Bazel* - from Google.
    * *Please* - Go-based build system.

# Monorepo downsides

.left-column-wide[

* It's very expensive:
    * High testing infrastructure costs.
    * Highly qualified and motivated DevOps teams.
        * Many configuration and infrastructure support work.
    * Highly qualified and motivated development teams.
        * One team lose - all lose.

* Monorepo can only survive in highly automated projects:
    * Manual testing should vanishing, as not scalable approach.
    * Multy-level automated testing: unit, integration, simulation, load, etc.
    * High tests coverage is a part of company's culture.

# Monorepo downsides

.left-column[

![:scale 80%](./flying_cash.png)

]

.right-column[
* May not work well for retail software companies with multiple products:
    * different release cycles
    * different target KPI
    * _even so, it is still valuable for a single product._

* Is not friendly to open source development by monolithic nature.

* Standard VCS could fail if your codebase is dramatically huge.
]

# Go and Monorepo

.left-column-wide[

* You can make "fake" monorepo with Go modules, but...
    * Single language support.
    * No distributed builds.
    * No incremental builds.

* Go support is available in:
    * *Bazel* is well known in the monorepo world, with amazing documentation and active new feature development.
    * *Buck* is not too famous and could have difficulties with adaptation.
    * *Please* is very friendly to Go projects but could have difficulties integrating other languages. Less famous than two other competitors.

# Conclusion

### Core benefits:

* monorepo resolves dependencies hell.

* monorepo decreases time to release readiness from days or months to hours.

* monorepo encourages collaboration and code sharing.

* monorepo simplifies refactoring and indirectly decreases technical debts.

### But:

* you can benefit from monorepo if you have one multi-component project.

* you must be ready to invest a lot in automatization and infrastructure.

* you should have a highly motivated DevOps team.

* all teams shall have a win-together mindset.
