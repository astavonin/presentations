# Agenda

* ### What is distributed system and why we may want to verify it?

* ### What do we need for distributed system verification?

* ### Proof as Code.

* ### Making Go implementation more reliable.

* ### Q&A

---
# Why here, why GoSG?

.left-column-wide[

* Go is one of the most obvious choices for distributed systems development.

* When we create a system, we may want to prove its correctness if needed.

* The presentation covers the beneficial but almost unknown way for distributed system verification.

# What is distributed system?
.left-column[
## Very high-level concept

* Set of ***actors***

* That have independent ***state***

* And interact with each other

* Using some ***protocols***

]

# What is distributed system?
.left-column-wide[
## Actor model.
### Each actor can:


* Send messages to other actors

* Receives messages from different actors

* May modify their own private state

* Can only affect each other indirectly through messaging

# What is distributed system?
.left-column-wide[
## Protocols.

* ***Actors*** interacts with each other using ***protocols***
* Protocol is an agreement between parties about:
    
    * messages format
        * each message for prepare/vote/ack/etc has its own structure

    * communication rules
        * `Prepare` -> `Vote` -> `Action` -> `Ack`
    
    * error recovery procedure, and so on.
        * `Commit` or `Rollback`

# What is distributed system?
.left-column-wide[
## State Machines.

* Each actor in a distributed system could be represented as a State Machine.

* Depending on the command sequence, actors can perform transitions between states.

    * cannot `Commit` before voting

    * but can `Abort` immediately when needed
    
    * shall `Abort` on global `Abort`

# What is distributed system?
## Potential issues.

* Fast growing amount of combinations.

    * Combinatorial explosion effect due to combination variations of all system's actors and failure conditions.

* Different network-specific issues increase potential failing conditions.

    * packages losses

    * packages duplicate

    * timeouts

    * changed packages order

* Sooner or later, it'll not be possible to verify system behavior manually.

# Distributed system verification
## When is formal verification needed?

In all cases, when cross-component misbehavior may put human life in danger or leads to significant money or reputational losses:

* Systems that may create massive damage (nuclear plants, Aerospace, Space).

* Systems that can harm people (Medical, Household).

* Systems that involve money (banking).

* Systems that guarantee data safety and integrity (backups, cloud storage).

---
# Distributed system verification
.left-column[
## How could protocol be proofed?

* Need to prove the validity of a non-deterministic system. 

* It would be possible if there were a way to represent a non-deterministic system as deterministic.

* We need some set of tests that verifies system properties.

# Proof as Code

Distributed systems are notoriously hard to get right (i.e., guaranteeing correctness) as the programmer needs to reason about numerous control paths resulting from the myriad interleaving of events (or messages or failures).

* We do not want to manually validate, as any protocol update requires full revalidation.
    * The situation is identical to testing automation. It's impossible to do complex modifications without it.

* Find a way to describe a distributed system as a model.

* Create a model.

* Write expectations and validation rules

* Do a validation.


---
# P language is...
.left-column-wide[

* P is not a generic proposes language.

* but a State Machine based programming language to formally model and specify distributed systems.

* P provides a backend analysis engine to systematically explore behaviors of the system model and check that the model satisfies the desired correctness specifications.

* P includes Code Generator. Only supports C and C# which makes it not too exciting.

* Compiler and validator installation procedure look weird, as you need to install JVM and .NET. P language will use both of them, Java for code parsing and .NET for validation.

# How P checks correctness

* It looks like P uses C# under the hood because of Coyote.

* Coyote is .NET library and tool designed to help with detecting concurrency bugs.

* Coyote tests one async path at a time exploring all possible paths through the system.

    * non-deterministic system -> deterministic

* It also records this path so that when it finds a bug that bug is 100% reproducible.

// state initialization routine

// ... State Machine also host states

// ... with transition rules
    on eWithDrawResp do (resp: tWithDrawResp) {

// Monitors can also define new `event`s
event eSpec_BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect_Init: map[int, int];

// Monitors are also State Machines
spec BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect observes eWithDrawReq,  
    eWithDrawResp, eSpec_BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect_Init {
// ... which should observe system behavior from outside
  start state Init {
    on eSpec_BankBalanceIsAlwaysCorrect_Init 
            goto WaitForWithDrawReqAndResp 
            with (balance: map[int, int]){
      bankBalance = balance;

  (union Client, Bank, { TestWithMultipleClients });

// where test is... State Machine!
machine TestWithMultipleClients

# P: Reliability
.left-column-narrow[
## Test cases

* Sends are reliable, buffered, non-blocking, and directed (not broadcast).

* Sends are reliable i.e., executing a send operation in P adds an event into the target machines buffer. 

]
.right-column-wide[

```cpp
fun UnReliableSend(target: machine, message: event, payload: any) {
  // nondeterministically drop messages
  // $: choose()
  if($) send target, message, payload;
}

// unrelialbe broadcast function
fun UnReliableBroadCast(ms: set[machine], ev: event, payload: any) {
  var i: int;
  while (i < sizeof(ms)) {
    UnReliableSend(ms[i], ev, payload);
    i = i + 1;
  }
}
```
